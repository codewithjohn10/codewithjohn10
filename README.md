### 👨‍💻 A Bit About Me

I’m **John Gacugu Kahuria**, a **Senior PHP / Laravel Developer** based in **Nairobi, Kenya** — passionate about creating scalable, secure, and high-performance web applications.  

With **5+ years of experience**, I specialize in **Laravel (v8–12)**, **MySQL**, **Vue.js**, and **RESTful APIs**, and I enjoy building clean, optimized systems that make real business impact.  

I love mentoring developers, optimizing performance, and implementing modern architectures that keep codebases maintainable and efficient.
